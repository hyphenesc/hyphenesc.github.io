Forced to stay inside, mostly in isolation, I've been coming back to Radiohead. Here's my take on their 2007 release: _In Rainbows_.

I am a lucky guy, I admit it, my job allows me to work from home, I have most of my needs covered, and for about 4 years I've been getting free music streaming. Around 2016 I started getting into music beyond Bono, naturally I had to decide between Spotify and Apple Music. I had a somewhat extensive music collection on iTunes, and I've heard (at the time) Spotify artists got lower pay. Plus Spotify's UI is not the best in my eyes, so I went with Apple. I would eventually eat my own words because Apple Music glitched out on me and when I signed up as a students It gave me 1 month for free for being a new user, plus a second free month for being a new user as a student. That was not supposed to happen, I found out because I cheeked my balance after 1 month and it said I was still under a free month. When the 2nd moth ended my app glitched and forgot my user name, so I signed on, but it had forgot I was a student, I signed into my uni's email again and it treat me as a *brand new student*. So I got a 3rd free month. Not kidding this happened up until 3 moths ago, meaning I have been an Apple Music user for 4 years, I've only paid for 6 months, got around 3 and a half of service for free.

In that period of time I've lessened to new music, and it has tremendously opened up my eyes. Growing up I was a U2's pop singles fanatic, the most "heavy" rock music I listened was the Killer's *Sams town*. They were my favorites, but I only got deep into The Killers. Listened to all their albums and rare demos.
