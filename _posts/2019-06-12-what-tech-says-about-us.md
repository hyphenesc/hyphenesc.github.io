title: "How Digital Technologies Reflect Who We Are - New post on the Digital Rights Blog"
---

As I mentioned [long ago][1], I am starting a new project to promote human rights online.<!--more--> I call it *digital rights* and on it's website me and the community will be posting articles, writing blogs, creating videos and podcasts about technology and how we can make it more humane.

The project had been slowing down [since it's inception][2], but recently I've picked up the steam and I managed to publish the first article titled *How Digital Technologies Reflect Who We Are*.

This is an introduction to digital rights, its purpose is to allow ourselves to ask questions about tech like *what kind of impact does it have on society?*

If you'd like to find out head over to the article and subscribe to the site's blog or it's [social media accounts][3] for getting notifications when new content gets published.
