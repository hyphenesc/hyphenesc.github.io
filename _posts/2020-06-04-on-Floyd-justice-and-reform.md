On May 25, 2020 an innocent man, George Floyd, was yet another victim of police brutality. Derek Chauvin, a police officer, knelled on his neck ending his life.<!--more-->

The killing of Floyd inspired protests against police brutality, racial prejudice and it served as a mainstream revival for the black lives matter movement. However, in today's political climate and popular discourse the main image sparked by the protests are the riots sprawled by the protests and the overall class and race malaise. A naive fixation and preoccupation with the riots is honestly a good one to begin with. But one must not stop to criticize a movement by its perceived wrongs alone. We, newcomers to politics and social justice, ask ourselves: What makes people riot? Are they justified? What should be done by authorities against rioters? Should *I* support the riots?

A good starting point this can become *if*, and only if we ask ourselves what are the underlying, or implied, questions within the questions. Let's go one by one.

## What makes people riot?

If we break this question down we can start by simply focusing on each word, and then asking what images, or ideas, these concepts spurl in our minds. What are our preconceived ideas and notions about each single part of the question. The world *What* is of course required for the question to work, *makes* is too. But we can start to paint a more thorough picture by analyzing the words *people* and *riot*. Rioters are, by definition, a turbulent and unlawful conflict. Here the law comes into place. Without many scrutiny we know the position of the law on the matter, riots are in the eyes of the law a bad phenomenon. By simply using the word *riot* we are "poisoning the well". We start asking questions with implied answers within. We could just replace the sentence with: *what makes bad behaving people act in bad ways in the eyes of the law?* This is why we can't take these questions, however genuine, at face value. Because their content is not present at face value, they hold "hidden" (or implied, presupposed) meanings.

If we can't answer this loaded question - with an implied black and white answer -without getting an equally loaded answer, what sort of question we can ask without indenting a hidden bias? The loaded part of the question is mostly at the *unlawful* part. Therefore we must find a more neutral term for this sort of unlawful behavior. First, we can quickly acknowledge the strange nature of laws. Laws are a legislated code of conduct, meant to keep order within a society. Therefore we can invoke an *Idealist* vision for law, they are supposed to be created from a basic notion of morality. Lawmakers start with asking questions about whats right and wrong for a society to develop. Here we can start to pour our super-egos into a bucket and declare right from wrong in the broad sense.
