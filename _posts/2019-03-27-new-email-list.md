After playing around with RSS I came across `FeedBurner`<!--more-->, it allowed me to do a podcast for free, I explained my setup on [my previous post][1] and it's all possible thanks to `FeedBurner`.

With this newly discovered tool I created an email mailing list for this blog, now you can click the subscribe button at the top and click on the email subscription link.

Now you should take in mind that `FeedBurner` is owned by Google, if you're serious about your digital privacy you should consider subscribing via RSS, the link is also on the subscribe page up top.
