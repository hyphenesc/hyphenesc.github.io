Their platform is brilliantly simple, just write and publish to the fediverse without having to worry about any technicalities. I have nothing but praise for them, in my experience they seem to value user experience as much as users do.

At the beginning I had problems with the service, [just like Twitter had done to me][3], Write.as flagged me as a bot. Unlike Twitter, Write.as has actual humans doing actual support - actually.

I reached out by e-mail and Daniel quickly responded:

> Hey Alex,

> Sorry about that -- our systems are a bit rudimentary and sometimes catch legitimate posts. Just let me know what your username is and we'll disable the spam filter for your account.

After I provided him with my username he then replayed:

> Of course, happy to help!
> 
> I've just disabled the spam filter, so you should be able to publish freely now. Please let us know if you ever encounter other issues, though.

How nice of them!
