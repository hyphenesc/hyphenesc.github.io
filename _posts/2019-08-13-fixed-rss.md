I haven't really looked at [the reddit][1] since I set it up, it look's like it's not working properly. Now it should work.

The problem was my RSS feed, oh my precious feed, Since I messed around with the Jekyll site's path ,url & baseurl It changed the output of the feed.

The feed was set up something like this:


	<link>{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}</link>

Meaning it would link to a website made out of the variable `site.url` followed by the variable `post.url` vervatium. Problem was that `site.url` is set to `alex-esc.github.io` and post url is the name of the post file with a slash, meaning it would create a link like this: `alex-esc.github.io//title`. Instead of like this: `alex-esc.github.io/posts/title`

My superb fix was simply adding `/posts` to the code, take that compsci degree!
 
	<link>{{ site.url }}/posts{{ post.url }}</link>
 
Now that the RSS feed is valid and creates the proper links, it should post correctly to the reddit, mastodon, twitter & email [thanks to IFTTT][2].

(this post itself servers as a test for my fix, maybe it works, maybe it docent)
