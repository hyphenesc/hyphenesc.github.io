title: "Becoming independent online, or how I DIY'd myself into the IndieWeb"

---

For [some time now][1] I have tried to express my vision of a healthier web, but the folks over at [the IndieWeb][2] have found the vocabulary I was long searching for regarding the Web.<!--more--> Since I starting writing, and what would later become bloging, I have found a home on here. GitHub Pages was a new tool for me, a shiny toy to play with. On my honeymoon with GitHub I developed an appreciation for Markdown; on [a thorough blog post][3], Markdown creator John Gruber lay down the goals and philosophy of his new HTML generator tool; this was what made me stay on GitHub, Markdown was, and still is, one of the most enjoyable tools I use on a daily basis, and it's integration within all of GitHub made them like peanut butter and jelly.

My slice of the Internet pie was thereafter my current domain *alex-esc.github.io*. It allowed me to publish my writings, create a document organization map, short links for my personal use, and a home. But being in charge of my website gave me something else I struggled to put into words until quite recently. Writing, editing previous posts, organizing my documents and endlessly tweaking the look and functionality of my site was... well, it was fun! But fun in the sort of way I suspect being involved in social media is: Choosing the perfect profile picture, drafting the perfect comment and performing one self to the world.

Recently I've also experienced a change of heart and mind on lot's of issues. After getting deeply into tech, then [linux-y YouTubers][4], then social media skepticism, this lead me to search for digital media critical people and thinkers, on my search to dive deeper into social media contrarianism [I came across][5] the work of [Douglas Rushkoff][6]. Doug's a genius, his latest project *Team Human* is more like a media ecosystem, it's a book, a podcast, a Medium column and a community. He's whole thing is to analyze tech as a medium and see how people are reacting and adapting to it. Rushkoff was actually the first person I heard actually using some theory, in the past I've followed so called ["intellectuals"][7], but not a single one of them ever refereed to theory or data, they would often dip their feet into reading some academic journal, reading only a few cherry-picked sentences or the header and [calling it enough research][8], this actors rather use logic itself, because why would you need to seek and interpret the facts and competing theories when the tools of logic and deductive reasoning are unbiased? Well turns out that logical fallacies are not weapons on your arsenal to win a debate, nor spells to cast the truth out of thin air. The sort of theory Doug used was part of the humanities rather than the cold sciences, I was listening to Marxist ideas without calling them out by name, Douglas talks about information distribution, access to the means of production online and optimizing tools and Internet services to work against social and economic injustice.

Coming from a very [/g/][9]-like understanding of tech I came to value values such as anonymity, privacy, freedom and I developed a gut reaction against censorship. Thus my journey to break out of the proprietary silos begun. I would use privacy invasive software no more, delete my social accounts and begun to look for an online space that matched my newly found values. I used to theorize about my ideal social space online: First it has to be out of corporate control, a decentralized system was the only way I new this could be achieved; all uses should have the option to remain nameless, similar to reddit sudo-names combined with twitter verification system; all posts and interactions should be done with peer to peer protocols, each user should own their own profile, pictures, posts and intellectual property for their content, a combination between self hosting and peer to peer scarping of information or profiles would be required; to avoid censorship a public ledger should be systematized, were all users can verify the validity and location of each user. My vision for the perfect privacy-FOSS-anonymous web was more in line with 4Chan itself, as I would soon realize. The similarities stem not form implementation or methodology, but from outcome: A social pace with all ideas on the table, self moderations, zero censorship or content removal and content aggregated by popularity of ideas is where the parallels with Chan boards begin to show up. If everything is allowed and users can not be forced to comply with social norms, then are we doomed to let Nazi activists an equal treatment as users who just want to chat with their friends after school. The mindset I had trapped me, if absolute privacy and absolute free speech are key I *had* to platform harmful people.

Then my politics 180° turn happened. Thanks to watching hours upon hours of reactionary YouTube content my mind developed an inner voice that would push back against identity politics, social justice and other right wing talking points. The Sam Harris inside my head hated when Rushkoff said anything about social justice, I thought he was wrong to cave in *SJW arguments*, but if I ignore it I can still absorb the rest of Rushkoff's wisdom. It was until an episode of the *Team Human* podscast simply titled: *It’s Capitalism, Mate*.

Now I saw the other side of the coin for the first time. I began to dive into the interviewees on the podcast, read the book, read into the book citations, I found a new media environment of [leftist content on reddit][10] and it has served me as a playground for new ideas. I have finally opened up to embraced social justice and economic reform.

The new online political spaces I now inhabit are more preoccupied with systematic changes to the various online environments, rather than burning Twitter to the ground for not being Nazi tolerant like the online right, cyber-leftists are more interested in designing platforms for incursion and driving respect for marginalized communities - we want to democratize the Net, not to market-ize it.
